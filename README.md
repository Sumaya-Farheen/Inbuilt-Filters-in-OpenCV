Image filtering is the process of modifying an image by changing the pixel values based on certain criteria. It is a fundamental technique in image processing and computer vision. Image filtering can be done using various techniques like linear filtering, non-linear filtering, and deep learning-based filtering.
OpenCV is a widely used library for image processing and computer vision tasks. It provides several functions for image filtering like Gray scale, Gaussian Blur, Median Blur, Bilateral Filter, RGB Filter, Box Filter, 2D Filter, Threshold, Dilation and Erosion.
Deep learning-based image filtering is a recent development in the field of computer vision. It involves using deep neural networks to perform the filtering tasks.
In general, image filtering is used to improve the quality of images by removing noise, blurring or sharpening edges, enhancing contrast, and reducing artifacts. It is used in various applications like image recognition, object detection and face recognition. It can help in improving the quality of images and making them more suitable for further processing and analysis.
